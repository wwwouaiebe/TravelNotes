<h2 id="1-why-travel--notes">1. Why Travel &amp; Notes</h2>
<p>I go from time to time on a bike travel for several weeks, sometimes in isolated areas. This kind 
of travel can not be improvised, even if there is always a part of unforeseen. I needed a tool to 
prepare my route from the map and to add notes.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, there are a lot of applications that can make a route from one point to another, but 
none really gives me satisfaction: I do not often look for the shortest route - sometimes it&#39;s even 
a circular route - and in general we&#39;re limited to a few hundred kilometers.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also important to be able to record what has been prepared because it is not done in a 
few minutes. You must also be able to print the result. In some isolated areas, there is not always 
a mobile network or the possibility of recharging a battery. A good old hard copy is often valuable.</p>
<p><a id="SomeExplanations"></a></p>
<h2 id="2-some-explanations-on-the-terms-used">2. Some explanations on the terms used</h2>
<p>A <strong>route</strong> connects two points. On the map, it is represented by a polyline.</p>
<p>An <strong>itinerary</strong> is the description of the various changes of direction needed to follow a route.
A change of direction is a <strong>maneuver</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>travel</strong> consists of one or more routes. They do not have to touch each other at their ends.
There may also be more than two routes starting from the same point.</p>
<p>In a travel, some routes may be <strong>chained</strong> between them. In this case, the different chained routes 
will be considered as only one for the calculation of the distances. One and only one chain maybe 
created by travel, but it is not mandatory that all routes are included in the chain.</p>
<p>A <strong>note</strong> is a set of information that relates to a specific point on the map or on a route. A note 
consists of an icon, a tooltip, a free text, an address, a link and a phone number. None of this 
information is required, except for the icon, which is used to represent the note on the map. 
This icon can be an image, a photo, a text ...</p>
<p>The <strong>roadbook</strong> is an HTML page that contains all the information of the travel: the notes, the 
routes and the itineraries.</p>
<p><a id="OpenFileWithV200"></a></p>
<h2 id="3-open-a-travel-file-created-with-a-version-earlier-than-v200">3. Open a travel file created with a version earlier than v2.0.0</h2>
<p><strong>ATTENTION : It is not possible to open with version 1.x.x a file saved with version 2.0.0</strong></p>
<p>You may still need the older version to make corrections in the notes.
You can do two installations of Travel &amp; Notes without any problem. You just have to place them 
in different directories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make a backup copy of your travel files</strong>.</li>
<li>Open Travel &amp; Notes v2.0.0 and also open the browser&#39;s web console.</li>
<li>Open a file to convert.</li>
<li>The list of all deleted html tags and attributes is displayed in the console and the travel
displayed in Travel &amp; Notes.</li>
<li>Correct any errors by using your old version and then reopening your travel with version 2.0.0. OR directly
make the necessary corrections in version 2.0.0.</li>
<li>Do not panic. The only fixes I had to make in my files were links which were incorrect anyway and 
therefore didn&#39;t lead to anything.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="BeforeStart"></a></p>
<h2 id="4-before-you-start-using-travel--notes">4. Before you start using Travel &amp; Notes</h2>
<p>If you use Travel &amp; Notes only to create notes, you can skip all the part about the access keys. 
These are only used for calculating routes and the display of certain maps.</p>
<p>Travel &amp; Notes does not calculate routes and itineraries. It connects to a route provider to get 
this itinerary. The different route providers that can currently be used are GraphHopper, Mapbox, 
Stadia Maps, OpenRouteService and OSRM. It is also possible to draw a polyline between two places, without 
following paths. A train route between two stations can also be added, provided
that this route is encoded in OpenStreetMap, respecting the rules of public transport version 2.</p>
<p>For GraphHopper, OpenRouteService, Stadia Maps and Mapbox it is necessary to have an access key (<strong>API Key</strong>) 
to connect to the server. Check the websites of these different providers to obtain an access key.</p>
<p>You must also correctly read the conditions of use of the access keys and check that what you do 
with Travel &amp; Notes corresponds to these conditions of use.</p>
<p>For the display of certain maps (Thunderforest, Lantm√§teriet - Sweden, Mapbox), an access key
is also essential. For other maps, this is not necessary (OpenStreetMap,
aerial view ESRI, IGN - Belgium, Kartverket - Norway, Maanmittauslaitos - Finland).</p>
<p>You are also responsible for the use of your access keys. Remember that there may be billing that 
is done based on these access keys. Do not give them to anyone or do not let them hang around anywhere.</p>
<p><a id="APIKeys"></a></p>
<h3 id="41-how-to-introduce-your-access-keys-in-travel--notes">4.1. How to introduce your access keys in Travel &amp; Notes</h3>
<p>Access keys are managed from the access keys dialog. To view it, click the üîë button 
in the toolbar at the top of the interface.</p>
<img src="APIKeysDialogEN.PNG" />

<p>For each service provider, you must indicate on the left the name of this service provider and on the right
the access key. The different names currently possible are &#39;GraphHopper&#39;, &#39;Lantmateriet&#39;,
&#39;Mapbox&#39;, &#39;MapzenValhalla&#39;, &#39;OpenRouteService&#39; et &#39;Thunderforest&#39; (insensitive to upper / lower case).</p>
<p>Use the + button to add a service provider and the ‚ùå button on the right to delete this one.</p>
<p>When your access keys are entered, press the button üÜó to finish.
Your keys are saved in the &quot;sessionStorage&quot; of the browser and available until the tab is closed.</p>
<p>It is possible to save the access keys in a file, protected by a password or unprotected.</p>
<p><strong>Attention</strong>: the page must be served in HTTPS to save in a file protected by a password.</p>
<p>The üîÑ button is used to reload the access keys file from the web server, if a file was previously found on the server.</p>
<p>The button üíæ on the <strong>left</strong> of the dialog box allows you to save the access keys
in a password protected file. This must contain at least 12 characters including at least 
one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, and one other character.</p>
<p>The button üìÇ on the <strong>left</strong> of the dialog box replaces all the access keys of the
dialog box with the contents of a password protected file.</p>
<p>These two buttons are only present if all the conditions to be able to save / restore the
keys with a password are met.</p>
<p>The button üíæ on the <strong>right</strong> of the dialog box allows you to save the access keys in
a file <strong>not protected</strong> by password.</p>
<p>The button üìÇ on the <strong>right</strong> of the dialog box replaces all the access keys of the
dialog box by the contents of a file <strong>not protected</strong> by password.</p>
<p>These two buttons are only present if they have been enabled in the TravelNotesConfig.json file.</p>
<p>If a password protected file named <strong>APIKeys</strong> is placed in the same directory as
Travel &amp; Notes on the server, Travel &amp; Notes will ask you for the password when you open it 
in order to use the keys contained in this file.</p>
<p>For geeks and paranos also see in the <a href="InstallationGuideEN.html#TravelNotesConfigJson">installation guide</a> and in the file TravelNotesConfig.json:</p>
<ul>
<li>APIKeys.saveToSessionStorage to save or not the keys in the sessionStorage</li>
<li>APIKeysDialog.showButton to show or hide the üîë button in the toolbar</li>
<li>APIKeysDialog.showAPIKeys to show or hide the keys as a password in the dialog box</li>
<li>APIKeysDialog.haveUnsecureButtons to show or hide the buttons üíæ and üìÇ on <strong>right</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The old method consisting in entering the access keys via the url is removed.</p>
<p><a id="ContextMenus"></a></p>
<h2 id="5-context-menus">5. Context menus</h2>
<p>All map objects (waypoints, notes, routes, map) have a context menu. All the commands related to 
these objects can be found in these context menus.</p>
<p>The same menus are found in the user interface on the right of the screen. Right clicking on a route in the routes list 
will display a context menu for that route, right clicking on a note in the route description or in the travel notes list 
will display a context menu for that note and right clicking on a maneuver in the route description will display a 
context menu for that maneuver.</p>

<p>It is also possible to change the width of the route as well as the type of line and also chaining 
the route.</p>
<p>Finally you can change the color used to display the route. Select a color from the 6 rows of 
colored buttons. The slider under the colored buttons adds more or less shade of red in the colors offered.</p>
<p>Each shade of red, green and blue for the desired color can also be set individually via the 3 color editing areas.</p>

<h3 id="814-print-route-maps">8.14. Print route maps</h3>
<p>Please note: this command is experimental. It may not work with your Travel &amp; Notes installation 
if you have added other elements to the page. Moreover, browsers do not all react in the same way to
css tags, especially those that force a page break when printed.
If this command does not suit you, you can disable it from the TravelNotesConfig.json file (printRouteMap.isEnabled). See the <a href="InstallationGuideEN.html#TravelNotesConfigJson">installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>Right-click on the route for which you want to print the maps and select &quot;Print the maps for this route&quot; 
from the context menu.</p>
<p>The edit box is displayed:</p>
<img src="PrintRouteMapDlgEN.PNG" />

<p>&quot;Paper width&quot; et &quot;Paper height&quot;: this is the width and height of the printable area of the paper.
 You must check this with your printer.</p>
<p>&quot;Border width&quot;: it is an area around the map and inside it which will be reprinted in the 
following map.</p>
<p>&quot;Zoom&quot; : the zoom to use for maps. It is independent of the zoom used to display the map before launching 
the command. For reasons of performance of the tile servers, it is not possible to use a zoom 
larger than 15.</p>
<p>&quot;Print notes&quot; when this box is checked, the notes icon is printed on the map.</p>
<p>Finally, select the browser you are using (either Firefox or another Chrome-based browser).
This choice is important: the map can be badly cut at the bottom of the page in the case of a bad choice.</p>
<p>When the edit box is closed with the &quot;ok&quot; button, the map and controls are replaced by views of the map that 
have the desired dimensions and two buttons are present at the top right:</p>
<img src="PrintRouteMapToolbar.PNG" />

<p>The button üñ®Ô∏è will launch the print command from your browser and the button &#x274c; 
will cancel printing and redisplay the map.</p>
<p>When the print command of the browser is closed, the print views will also be closed and 
the map redisplayed.</p>
<p>All the default values of the edit box can be modified in the TravelNotesConfig.json file.
See the <a href="InstallationGuideEN.html#TravelNotesConfigJson">installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>Avoid overloading the tile servers. Issue this command only if you really need it.
Decreasing the paper size, the margin size and the zoom will also decrease the number of tiles required.</p>
<p>When the edit box is closed, the program calculates the number of tiles required. If this number is too 
large, the command is stopped.</p>
<h4 id="some-tips-for-printing">Some tips for printing</h4>
<ul>
<li>indicate as &quot;paper height&quot; the actual height of your paper minus the top and bottom printing margins minus 1 mm</li>
<li>for geeks: you can insert a css file in the html page with a css @page rule to fix the dimensions,
 orientation and margins of the paper:<pre><code>@page {
size: A4 landscape;
margin: 7mm;
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Check that everything is correct with the &quot;Print preview&quot; command.</p>

<p>At the top of the box, a drop-down list allows you to choose predefined notes. It is possible to 
modify this list. See the <a href="InstallationGuideEN.html#TravelNotesNoteDialogJson">installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>The ‚ñº button hides or displays certain editing areas which are hidden by default (the two controls allow you to modify 
the dimensions of the icon and the telephone number). It is possible to choose which areas are hidden by default. 
Consult the <a href="InstallationGuideEN.html#TravelNotesConfigJson">installation guide</a>;</p>
<p>The üìÇ button allows you to upload your own file with notes predefined in Travel &amp; Notes. 
See the [installation guide] (InstallationGuideEN.html#TravelNotesNoteDialogJson) for how to create this file.                                                                                           </p>
<p>All the other buttons are modifiable and allow you to insert html tags or predefined text in the edit zones. 
Consult the <a href="InstallationGuideEN.html#TravelNotesConfigJson">installation guide</a>;</p>
<p>The &quot;Icon Content&quot; area will be used to represent the note on the map and can not be empty 
(leaving this area blank would prevent any subsequent changes to the note).</p>
<p>The &quot;Address&quot; zone is automatically completed when creating the note - 
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim">Nominatim</a> is used for the street name and
OverpassAPI for the municipality name.
This area will never be changed by Nominatim afterwards, even if the note has been moved. 
The button üîÑ allows, however, to request a new geolocation to Nominatim/OverpassAPI.</p>
<p>If the phone edit box contains only a valid phone number (= starting with a + and then only digits or the 
characters #, * or space), the phone number will be displayed with a tel: link and a sms: link.</p>
<p>Each edit zone can contain plain text or html, with the exception of the &quot;Link&quot; zone which can only contain a valid link.</p>

<li>the tag &lt;polyline&gt; with the attributes points and transform</li>
</ul>
<p>For all tags, id, class, dir and title attributes can also be used.</p>
<p>The rules for editing html are of course applicable:</p>
<ul>
<li>an opening tag AND a closing tag must be used: &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum... &lt;/p&gt;</li>
<li>attribute values must always be placed between &quot; : class=&quot;myClass&quot;</li>
<li>the characters &lt; and &gt; are reserved for tags and cannot be used elsewhere.
If you absolutely need these characters, you should replace them with the html entities &amp;lt; for &lt; and
&amp;gt; for &gt;.</li>
<li>double quotes are reserved for delimiting attribute values. If necessary use the html entity &amp;quot;.</li>
<li>the character &apos; cannot be used and must be replaced by the html entity &amp;apos;.</li>
<li>the character &amp; is ambiguous and should only be used in html entities</li>
<li>the non-breaking space must be inserted with the html entity &amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The urls introduced in the href and src attributes, as well as in the &quot;link&quot; edit zone must be valid urls:</p>
<ul>
<li>url&#39;s must be absolute links</li>
<li>url&#39;s cannot contain characters &lt;, &gt;, &apos; et &quot;</li>
<li>protocol must be http:, https:, mailto:, sms: or tel: for an href attribute</li>
<li>protocol must be https: for the src attribute (http: is also acceptable if the app&#39;s protocol is http:)</li>
<li>the pathname of the sms: and tel: links must start with a + and contain only the characters #, * or numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>As more text is inserted into an edit box, the app interprets the text and adapts the note preview accordingly. 
When the edit box is closed with the üÜó button, the text you entered is replaced by the one produced by 
the interpretation that the app made of it.</p>

<h4 id="9122-predefined-route-notes-svg-icon-from-osm">9.12.2. Predefined route notes &quot;SVG icon from OSM&quot;</h4>
<p>When creating a route note, you can choose &quot;SVG icon from OSM&quot; in the list of predefined notes. 
In this case, Travel &amp; Notes will search OpenStreetMap the nearest intersection located on the 
route and will create an SVG icon showing the streets near this intersection.</p>
<p>The intersection will be placed in the center of the icon and its content will be oriented 
according to the path followed: the route by which one arrives at the intersection will be 
turned towards the bottom of the icon.</p>
<p>The address will also be modified: all the street names found at the intersection will be indicated, 
separated by a symbol ‚™•. The first street name will always be the one by which we arrive at 
the intersection and the last name the one by which one leaves the intersection. 
This name will be preceded by an arrow indicating the direction to follow. The name of the 
town / city will also be added. If a hamlet or village name is found near the intersection, 
it will also be added in parentheses.</p>

<li>For each tag &lt;trk&gt; found in the .gpx file, a route is created in TravelNotes</li>
<li>The contents of all tags &lt;trkseg&gt; found inside a &lt;trk&gt; are merged into a single tag &lt;trkseg&gt;
and, consequently, the missing sections of the route, due to an interruption of the gps reception, are replaced by a straight line.</li>
<li>If one and only one tag &lt;rte&gt; is found in the .gpx file, then:<ul>
<li>If a &lt;name&gt; is found in the &lt;rte&gt; tag, the content of this tag will be used as the name for the created route.</li>
<li>For each tag &lt;rtept&gt; found in the &lt;rte&gt; tag, a maneuver is created from the content of this tag and added to the route. However, no icon will be created for this maneuver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If any &lt;wpt&gt; tags are found in the .gpx file and if only one route has been added then a waypoint is created for each &lt;wpt&gt; tag and this waypoint will be added to the route.
Additionally, if the .GPX file was created from <a href="https://www.fietsnet.be/routeplanner/default.aspx">fietsnet.be</a> or <a href="https://knooppuntnet.be/">knooppuntnet.be</a>, a note with the number of the knot will be created.</li>
